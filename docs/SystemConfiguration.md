# Introduction

The GW4 Alliance, together with Cray Inc. and the Met Office, has been
awarded Â£3m by EPSRC to deliver a new Tier 2 high performance computing
(HPC) service for UK-based scientists. This unique new service, named
"Isambard" after the renowned Victorian engineer Isambard Kingdom
Brunel, will provide multiple advanced architectures within the same
system in order to enable evaluation and comparison across a diverse
range of hardware platforms. - <http://gw4.ac.uk/isambard/>
**Technical Details**

Phase one was installed in March 2017 and was supplied with a number of
Nvidia Tesla "Pascal" GPU nodes and Intel Xeon Phi "Knights Landing"
nodes. When installed phase 2 will provide "10000+" ARMv8 cores.

**Phase 1**

Phase one was installed with the following components:

-   2x Login nodes

-   2x Management nodes with shared storage

-   4x GPU nodes each with 2x Nvidia Tesla P100 "Pascal" GPUs

-   8x Intel Xeon Phi nodes each with 1x Intel Xeon Phi "Knights
    Landing" 7210 CPU

-   1x Sonexion 3000 SSU for high-speed storage

All connected via EDR Infiniband (100 Gigabit/s) and a 1 Gigabit
Ethernet management network. Four 10 Gigabit links connect the login and
management nodes to the Met Office network.
